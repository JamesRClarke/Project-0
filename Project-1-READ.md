### The Project

This project was to build a working game which invlolved a certain level of creativity and complexity.
The game needed to involve a winning condition.

The game I created was insipired by tetris and mixed with my liking of problem soloving, so using anagrams was a good way to merge the two.

Here is a screenshot of the instructions of the game

### Software and Languages 

Here is a list of the software and languages used in the project:

- HTML 5
- SCSS 
- JavaScript ES6
- jQuery 3.10
- Gulp
- NPM
- Git & GitHub

### Blockers and Obstacles

An obstacle which was necessary to overcome was the validation of each anagram that is falling. I needed to be able validate and apply styling to correctly solved anagram, and different styling to the other.
By using `this` I was able to overcome this obstacle.

Another challenege that was key, was working with the height and width of the `div` where the game is played. When making it responsive this caused a lot of issues, however using `.height()` and `.width()` and `window.resize()` I was able to store the pixel value into variables and apply to the working code so responsiveness now does not cause an issue.

### Enhancement and Development

I have compiled a list of advancements I would like to add to my project, these were not worked on due to either timing or simply not knowing how to: 

- adding a high score counter based on length of anagram(s)
- name spacing the project
- adding audio to the game based on difficulty e.g. faster tron music the harder the difficulty
- better styling of the page
